# Labels on A4 paper

In this example we will print a barcode with 2 custom text items on A4 paper. To use this example on any other paper size, you just need to change the
paper *width* and *height* in the style.css file.

You might need to change the label width and height depending on your type of paper. You can do this by changing the *width* and *height* of the *print-area* object in style.css.

In this example we will print a matrix of custom labels on A4 paper.

<p align='center'><img src="./screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width='600'></p>

To print the generated PDF file to the A4 paper, it is important to set the proper configuration for the page in the printer settings. We need to set margins to 0 as shown in the example below:

<p align='center'><img src="./printer-page-configuration.png" alt="screenshot" width='400'></p>
